# VBA-challenge
Challenge_2
My code is inside of the file named Code_challenge2.odt, that itÂ´s also inside of this repository.

The code only works for the file named Multiple_year_stock_data, it also works fot the file alphabetical_testing, but you need to change the names of the sheets.

I tried to upload the excel file with the macros, but the size was to big, so you will need to copy and paste my code to the file named Multiple_year_stock_data.

I found this line of code "Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row" that help me to found the last row with data here: https://es.ccm.net/aplicaciones-e-internet/ofimatica/4028-vba-ultima-fila-que-contiene-datos-cualquier-version/
